# Create Minecraft Miner
Custom mining script for a Create miner in Minecraft

PLEASE BE AWARE OF THESE DEFAULTS AS YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THEM IF THEY ARE DIFFERENT!
THIS IS SET UP TO NOT USE THE CREATE PORTABLE ITEM INTERFACE AS IT DOES NOT WORK PREDICTABLY! USE SOMETHING LIKE MEKANISM PIPES INSTEAD!

gearbox = "left"
gantryAxle = "back"
clutch = "front"

deposit row = 2
default depth = 256 (WIP)(max length of pulley carriage in Create)

Input to the clutch is 1,024 SU at 256 RPM CLOCKWISE (easily done with the smallest steam turbine).
May work on configuration in the future for CCW and lower RPMS (but let's be honest, you might as well run it full-speed)

THIS MINER WAS TESTED IN SINGLE-PLAYER, BUT SHOULD WORK IN MULTIPLAYER (I MAKE NO GUARANTEES).
IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS/ISSUES LEAVE THEM ABOVE AND I WILL TRY AND ADDRESS THEM!
